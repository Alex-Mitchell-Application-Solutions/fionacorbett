/**
 * Object storage for uploads.
 *
 * Deployed environments use a Railway S3 bucket. A Railway container's disk does
 * not survive a redeploy, so every photograph Alex uploads and every photograph
 * a guest attaches would vanish on the next deploy without this. On this site
 * that is not a degraded experience, it is the loss of the only copy of
 * something somebody scanned.
 *
 * The variable names here are ours, not Railway's. A Railway bucket exposes
 * BUCKET, ENDPOINT, REGION, ACCESS_KEY_ID and SECRET_ACCESS_KEY; the service
 * maps them across with reference variables. Keeping our own names costs one
 * mapping step and makes moving off Railway a config change rather than a code
 * change.
 *
 * Local development falls back to the disk, so a checkout runs with nothing but
 * Postgres. The switch is the presence of S3_BUCKET rather than NODE_ENV,
 * because staging and production are the same code path and a developer should
 * be able to point at a real bucket when reproducing something.

/**
 * The storage plugin, registered in every environment and enabled only where a
 * bucket is configured.
 *
 * Registered always, because the plugin shapes the schema as well as the
 * storage: from Payload 3.90 it adds a hidden `_objectKey` column to every
 * collection it manages. Registering it conditionally gives the upload tables
 * one shape in production and another on a machine with no bucket, and a
 * migration generated on that machine cannot see the column production needs.
 * The symptom is every media query failing in production with
 * `column media._objectkey does not exist`, and the next migration generated the
 * other way round proposing to drop it.
 *
 * `alwaysInsertFields` is the plugin's own answer: disabled, it adds its fields
 * and does nothing else, so the schema is identical everywhere and a migration
 * generated anywhere is correct everywhere. Payload 4 makes it the default.
 *
 * `prefix: ''` is stated rather than omitted, and it is not decoration. The two
 * paths add the prefix column on different conditions — disabled, because of
 * alwaysInsertFields; enabled, only when the collection names a prefix — so left
 * unset, a migration generated with S3 on proposes dropping a column the
 * without-S3 schema has. An empty prefix is where the objects already are, so it
 * changes no object key.
 *
 * Disabled, the plugin never builds a client, so the placeholder bucket and
 * empty config below are read by nothing.
